    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    
    <p>This project aims to leverage data that we get from our partner and use this opportunity to provide insight and analysis to help restaurants/businesses to make better informed operational decisions that will be beneficial for their company. Restaurant owners do not necessarily have the time to dig into nuanced financial information, 
      so our project is an attempt to provide insightful content at-a-glance.
    </p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The 10 restaurants represent the top 10 restaurants with the highest order volume in 2020. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Delivery zones are delivery radiuses that our partner operates within. These delivery zones have a maximum delivery time of 10 minutes which allow our partner company to operate efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cost savings represent the 20% premium restaurants pay for competitors. This is what restaurants can save if they convert to our partner company. In order to make our findings realistic, 
    our cost saving calculation assumes that restuarants can convert 50% of competitor orders within these delivery zones to our partner.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p>Embed an MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p>
      The bar charts help visualize the top 10 restaurants by order volume and their related order volume data as well as their average distance (in miles) for all orders. 
      We added hover-linking through both bar charts that will change the color of the hovered bar to show the relation between the two charts. 
      There is also tool-tip included for the user to find the specific order volume or average order distance for that specific restaurant. 
      Given that information, we implemented details on demand pie charts for the bar the user ends up hovering over. 
      The pie charts help distinguish the distribution of order origin (grubhub, snackpass, etc...) as well as the distribution of orders outside delivery zones for that specific restaurant.
      If no bars are hovered, then the pie charts represent data for all 10 restaurants, whereas, if a bar is hovered, only that specific restaurant data is shown. 
      To elevate our project further, we decided to include a cost reduction aspect to our visualizations. 
      The cost reduction/saving represents what restaurants can save if they convert competitor orders to our partner company. 
      Similar to the pie chart, the cost savings is a detail on demand where if no restaurant bar is hovered, it represents total cost savings by all 10 restaurants. </br>
